        <p>I’m Imran Hasan. I’m a designer who codes. I'm also the author of Laying the Foundations (a book about design systems, web design, and product design). I’ve worked internationally, in-house, and remotely on projects for leading brands, agencies, startups, and charities. I care deeply about creating world-class, useful, and beautiful products that help people and make a difference. I can be as involved in your project as you need me to be; from the seed of the idea, to sketches, creative direction, design, copywriting, system design, and even the front-end with Python build.</p>

            <h3>Became a web devloper</h3>
            <p >I already learned the basic HTML and CSS.I can built ant simple website.I am even teach my grandma how to make simple website.My goal is to bulit 3 websites and learn advanced topics.
                After using the new computer for a few years, I sent a picture I had created to my uncles who work with 3D imaging. They were impressed, and asked me if I would like a professional imaging program. For my next birthday I received the digital imaging software Photoshop LE, renowned for its professional capabilities. This tool took my imaging skills to all new heights. I was able to quickly and easily create high-quality images, and could edit and enhance existing photos for professional-like results. Photoshop became by far my favorite program, and I spent much time expanding my imaging skills and knowledge.
